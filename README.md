Presentation Link: https://prezi.com/view/n7Z3KD55HmUSZAHj7DJI/

This dataset provides details of ‘my Uber Drives’ in year 2016. It provides analysis of ordinary Uber customer’s behavior and contains Start Date, End Date, Start Location, End Location, Miles driven, purpose of drive, gender, status and rider’s age.

The purpose of this project is to provide comprehensive analysis of Uber customer’s behavior based on survey data taken from Kaggle.com. These days growing number of people are now getting engaged on Uber technology that helps people in getting what they want and when they want. While Uber and other companies like Lyft, yellow cabs in the gig economy receive a lot of attention, a deep observation of Uber’s own data about its customers reveals them to be less consequential than most people assume. We wish to present the results of extensive analysis on Uber experiences across United states and application of specifics unique to consumer behavior. At the same time, we also wish to investigate a research and identify several problems that Uber customers are facing.

The results of this application provide useful information not only for Uber owner who may be able to develop more marketing strategies using consumer behavior like if there are less number of cabs available in particular area during peak hours then more cabs will be provided in those areas, but also for consumers who will be able to make better choices while booking cabs with different companies like fare comparison which will let them know how much can they save from a ride.
